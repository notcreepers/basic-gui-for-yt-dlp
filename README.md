# basic-gui-for-yt-dlp
Fairly barebones GUI for yt-dlp

## Backstory
Got pretty bored one night and decided "Fuck it, let's make a GUI for yt-dlp in python." Not expecting much to come from this. My first main python project and potentially my last.

## Installation
Literally just download the exe and run it. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, check my code and make it yourself. I used pyinstaller so it's gonna get picked up as a trojan by a few AVs. If you're using Avast, that's your fault. Also I don't care enough to make the yt-dlp window actually hide itself, so don't soil yourself when the command prompt opens and closes.

## Updates
Probably not going to update this very often unless I feel I need to fix something. Works well for my needs. I mainly set it up just for YouTube, so results may vary for other websites.

## VirusTotal
I already went ahead and ran it through VirusTotal myself. The sandboxes think it's a crypto miner, neat.
